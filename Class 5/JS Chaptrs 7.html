// First make a multiplying rule with use of var, let variable.
let value = 1 + 3 * 4;
console.log(value)
        //multiplying 3 by 4, then add 1 to the product, you get 13.
let value1 = 2 - 3 * 4;
console.log(value1)
//  //multiplying 3 by 4, then subtract 2 to the product, you get -10. 
var math = 5 * 3 + 4;
console.log(math)
//          //multiplying 5 by 3 then add 4 to the product, you get 19.
var math = 1 + (3 * 4);
console.log(math)
         //multiplying 3 by 4, then add 1 to the product, you get 13 .
 var resultOfComputation = (2 * 2) * 4 + 2;
console.log(resultOfComputation)
         //multiplying 2 by 2, then multiplying by 4 and also add 2 to the value, you get 18 .
 var math = ((5 * 5) * 4) - 2;
 console.log(math)  
         //multiplying 5 by 5, then multiplying by 4 and also subtract 2 to the value, you get 98 .
 let math1 = (2 + 2) + 2;
 console.log(math1)
 let math2 = (2 - 2) + 2;
 console.log(math2)
 let math3 = (2 - 2) + (3 + 2);
 console.log(math3)
let math4 = (10 + 10) / 3;
